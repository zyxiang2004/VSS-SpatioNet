This work is intended for submission to the *Scientific Reports* journal, where Open Access publication will facilitate wider scientific dissemination. By making VSS-SpatioNet accessible, I hope this work can serve as a resource that sparks further research and applications. My confidence in VSS-SpatioNet lies not in its current form alone, but in the potential it holds for adaptation and growth across diverse fields of study. I look forward to seeing how the community might expand on this foundation to address both known and unforeseen challenges in multimodal integration. ðŸ˜Š
